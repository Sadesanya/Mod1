    <h2>Personal Shopper</h2> 
    <p>
        Personal shoppers provide advice, guidance, and buying services to customers. They have an advanced knowledge of products, trends, and services, and become trusted consultants for each customer. This job involves communicating with clients to determine what they’re looking for, offering advice and knowledge of the best products to purchase, processing orders, and assisting with exchanges or returns. Since this job is appointment driven, personal shoppers work irregular schedules that sometimes include nights, weekends, and particularly holidays, when shopping season becomes busier. This job is well suited to people who are creative, have extensive knowledge of trends and the latest products, have excellent customer service skills, and don’t mind working inconsistent work schedules
    </p>
    <h2> Personal Shopper Duties and Responsibilities</h2>

           <h3> Based on job listings we analyzed, a personal shopper’s duties typically involve:</h3>
            
           <h4>Process Customer Orders</h4> 
            
            <h5>Personal shoppers process orders on behalf of customers either through live chat, telephone calls, or email, which involves discussing what the client is looking for as well as any specific features they need the items to have. This information is then logged in the order entry system.</h5>
            
            <h3>Recommend Products Based on Trends</h3>
            
           <p>Personal shoppers present their clients with the most detailed product information they can, to ensure customers are satisfied with their items. They also share must-have products based on the latest trends.
            
            Process Financial Adjustments
            
            If a client makes any payments toward services or goods, this needs to be adjusted in the system to verify the payment. If customers need to develop a payment plan for their items, personal shoppers work with them to determine if this is a possibility.
            
            Support Clients with Exchanges and Replacements
            
            Sometimes a client is dissatisfied with the item they receive, and in these cases personal shoppers support the customer with making an exchange or replacing the product with something more suitable.
            
            Maximize Client Base
            
            Personal shoppers build and grow their client base by focusing on strategic selling techniques and communicating proactively with existing and potential customers. This also involves networking at events and marketing their services on a regular basis. </p>
